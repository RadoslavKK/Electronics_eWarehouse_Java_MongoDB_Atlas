# Electronics_eWarehouse_Java_MongoDB_Atlas
Java-based inventory management system for electronic components : (transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors).

## Using : MongoDB Atlas and Maven.

- This is a learning project aimed at helping me explore **MongoDB Atlas** and enhance my **Java development skills**.  
- The project is still a work in progressâ€”some bugs remain to be resolved.  

### Future plans include:
  
- A new class will be added to securely handle the database password using a **private variable**. The password itself will be stored in a file that is **excluded from version control** and **not uploaded to this repository**.  
- **Encryption** will be applied to the password, along with a **decryption utility** integrated within the project to ensure secure access.
- - implementing a **menu-driven user interface** and adding features to better **sort and manage warehouse components**.
