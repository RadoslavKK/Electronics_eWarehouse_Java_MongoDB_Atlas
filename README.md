# Electronics_eWarehouse_Java_MongoDB_Atlas
Java-based inventory management system for electronic components : (transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors) using MongoDB Atlas and Maven.

- This is a learning project to help me explore MongoDB Atlas and improve my Java development skills.
- There are still some bugs to fix.
- I plan to add an option-based menu/user interface and include more features for sorting the warehouse components.
